I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best-and most grueling - time of my life. Since compliting the course, I've successfuly switched carrers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."</div>

I was encourged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and sttaf did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assitence. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certinaly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after reciving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"</div>
